<p>LSD:- Alberta, Saskatchewan, and parts of Manitoba and British Columbia are mapped on a grid system into townships of approximately 36 square miles (6 mi. x 6mi.). Each township consists of 36 sections (1 mi. x 1 mi). Each section is further divided into 16 legal subdivisions (LSDs). The numbering system for sections and LSDs uses a back-and-forth system where the numbers may be increasing either to the right or the left in the grid. Since the DLS system is based on actual survey data, there can be gaps in the coverage.Each section is further divided into a legal subdivision (LSD). Each LSD is a square of 1320 ft (402m) per side.

<p>Latitude:- Latitude is a measure of how far a point is from the Earths equator. Latitudes may vary from 0 to 90 in both north and south directions.
</p>
<p>Longitude:- Longitude is an angular distance that is measured using the prime meridian as a reference. The prime meridian is an imaginary line that connects the North and south poles while passing through Greenwich, England. The ranges for longitudes are 0 - 180 East and West.
